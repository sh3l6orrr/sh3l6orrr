### Duality

Not to mention the famous electricity-magnetism duality and light wave-paricle
duality in Physics.

The basis of math, and therefore all natural scienece, has a beautiful duality. **Curry-Howard Isomorphism**, officially.

In social science, examples are so many even in par with its conterpart. Progressivism & Conservatism,
Individualism & Collectivism, etc.

Wait, isn't natrual science and social science an example of duality itself? They gracefully
corresponds to material and mind, the two most basic philosophical notions.
