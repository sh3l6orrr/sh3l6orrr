        <b>Hi there. </b>
        <br>
        Here is where I write some progressive things.
        <br>
        So if you practise conservatism, don't hate me!

        <b>The world seems to be governed by duality.</b>
        <br>
        Not to mention the famous electricity-magnetism duality and light wave-paricle 
        duality in Physics.
        <br>
        The basis of math, and therefore all natural scienece, has a stunningly beautiful duality.
        Curry-Howard Isomorphism, officially.
        <br>
        In social science, examples are so many even in par with its conterpart. Progressivism&Conservatism,
        Individualism&Collectivism, etc.
        <br>
        Wait, isn't natrual science and social science an example of duality itself? They gracefully 
        corresponds to material and mind, the two most basic philosophical notions.

        <b>Programming languages seem to have an spiritual attribute.</b>
        <br>
        Swift is like INTP. It's rational, with a model so well-suited for the real world. 
        It's also designed with so much intuition and discretion in mind.
        <br>
        Javascript is like ENFP. It goes everywhere and is a popular guy.
