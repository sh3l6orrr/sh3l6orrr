        Hello there! But if you are a realist, I' afraid you've come to the wrong place!

    <p class="title">
        Duality governs the nature.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        <br>
        Not to mention the famous electricity-magnetism duality and light wave-paricle 
        duality in Physics.
        <br>
        The basis of math, and therefore all natural scienece, has a stunningly beautiful duality.
        Curry-Howard Isomorphism, officially.
        <br>
        In social science, examples are so many even in par with its conterpart. Progressivism&Conservatism,
        Individualism&Collectivism, etc.
        <br>
        Wait, isn't natrual science and social science an example of duality itself? They gracefully 
        corresponds to material and mind, the two most basic philosophical notions.
