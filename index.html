        Hello there! But if you are a realist, I' afraid you've come to the wrong place!

        How different is human society compared to animal society?

        There are so much super rich people in the world. Hilariously, many of them are philanthropists. They are the 
        people who are not only superior in the sense of status, intelligence, but also virtue.
        Indeed, superioity and inferiority established between man and man, despite being a stark violation of equality,
        is so natrual to exist in that there are people who loved to serve, and people who has the power.

        Not to mention the famous electricity-magnetism duality and light wave-paricle 
        duality in Physics.

        In social science, examples are so many even in par with its conterpart. Progressivism&Conservatism,
        Individualism&Collectivism, etc.
        <br>
        Wait, isn't natrual science and social science an example of duality itself? They gracefully 
        corresponds to material and mind, the two most basic philosophical notions.
