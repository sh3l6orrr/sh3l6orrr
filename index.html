        <b>Hi there. </b>
        <br>
        Here is where I write some progressive things.
        <br>
        So if you practise conservatism, don't hate me!

        <b>The world seems to be governed by duality.</b>
        <br>

        <b>I don't see any meaning of life.</b>

        Swift is like INTP. It's rational, with a model so well-suited for the real world. 
        It's also designed with so much intuition and discretion in mind.

        Javascript is like ENFP. It goes everywhere and is a popular guy.
